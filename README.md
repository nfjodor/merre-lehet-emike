This is a cold-hot game for team building.
To make this project, we need some device:
 - NodeMCU
 - 2 * ESP8266-12
 - A cheap nfc reader (the red PN532)
 - ws2812 leds (6 for finder, 1 for status led)
 - Plush baby (or anything else that need to be found when we play this game)

## Finder tool

I used an ESP8266-12 with 6 ws2812 leds.
